Project Overview: Traffic Accident Data Analysis Using Power BI

Objective:
To analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Scope:
This project involves collecting, processing, and analyzing traffic accident data to uncover insights that can help improve road safety. 

The analysis will focus on:

->Identifying accident hotspots.

->Understanding the impact of road conditions, weather, and time of day on accident frequency and severity.

->Visualizing these patterns and factors using Power BI.

Data Preparation:

->Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in data formats.

->Feature Engineering: Creating new features such as weather categories.

Analysis:

Descriptive Analysis: Summarizing the dataset to understand the distribution of accidents over time, by location, weather conditions, and road conditions.

Hotspot Analysis: Using geographic information to identify areas with high accident frequencies.

Correlation Analysis: Examining the relationships between accidents and factors like weather conditions, road conditions, and time of day.

Trend Analysis: Identified patterns and trends over different time periods.

Dashboard: Created interactive dashboard in Power BI to allow users to explore the data and insights dynamically.
