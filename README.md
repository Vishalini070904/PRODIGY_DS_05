Project Overview: Traffic Accident Data Analysis Using Power BI

Objective:
To analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Scope:
This project involves collecting, processing, and analyzing traffic accident data to uncover insights that can help improve road safety. 
The analysis will focus on:

->Identifying accident hotspots.
->Understanding the impact of road conditions, weather, and time of day on accident frequency and severity.
->Visualizing these patterns and factors using Power BI.

Data Preparation:

->Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure consistency in data formats.
->Data Integration: Combine accident data with weather and road condition data based on timestamps and locations.
->Feature Engineering: Create new features such as weather categories, and road condition types.

Analysis:

Descriptive Analysis: Summarize the dataset to understand the distribution of accidents over time, by location, weather conditions, and road conditions.
Hotspot Analysis: Use geographic information to identify areas with high accident frequencies.
Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationships between accidents and factors like weather conditions, road conditions, and time of day.
Trend Analysis: Identify patterns and trends over different time periods (e.g., rush hours, seasons).

Dashboard: Created interactive dashboard in Power BI to allow users to explore the data and insights dynamically.
